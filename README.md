vagrant-ansible-template
========================

Starter template for a single box with nginx/mysql/php

Assumes local development with parallels and production is a Digital Ocean virtual machine.

It is very easy to switch out parallels with virtualbox for local development if you prefer.
See the comments in the Vagrantfile for more information.
